# Contextual-Geolocation

### How The App Works

This app uses HTML5 Geolocation, Google Maps API (along with the Geometry Library), Sequelize, and MySQL to keep track of the user's position relative to their saved locations. 

Users can save locations and then add people to those locations. If a user is positioned at a saved location they will be able to see all of the people (their names, nicknames, job/roles, and any notes the user has saved about them) relative to that location. When the user leaves a saved location, the contacts then disappear from the screen, but users can still see all of their saved locations at any time and see the people saved in those locations, even if they are not positioned at a saved location.
